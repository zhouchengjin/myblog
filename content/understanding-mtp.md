Media Transfer Protocol (MTP) is a set of custom extensions to the Picture Transfer Protocol (PTP) devised by Microsoft for communication with portable devices. Initially developed for use with portable media players, MTP is now widely implemented across smartphones, tablets, and digital cameras.

Unlike USB Mass Storage (UMS), MTP doesn't give the host computer direct access to the storage media. Instead, it operates at the file level, which allows for safer transfers and better media management capabilities. This approach prevents potential file system corruption that can occur when a device is disconnected during file transfer operations.

MTP offers several advantages over traditional transfer methods. It allows for better synchronization of media files, preserves metadata during transfers, and provides a more reliable connection. The protocol is supported natively in Windows, macOS (through Android File Transfer), and Linux (via libmtp).

For developers, implementing MTP requires understanding the protocol's object-oriented structure. Devices present a hierarchical file system where each file and folder is treated as an object with properties. This structure enables rich metadata exchange and efficient media management.
